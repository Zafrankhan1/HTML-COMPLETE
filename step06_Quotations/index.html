         <blockquote cite=""http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html"">
            For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's
             leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every
              level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver
               innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in
                which they live.
